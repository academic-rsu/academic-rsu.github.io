2. Enable Authentication, Firestore Database, and Storage

### Configuration
1. Replace the Firebase configuration in `js/firebase-config.js` with your project's config:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-api-key-here",
    authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### Firebase Database Rules

Add these rules to your Firestore Database:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null; // Allow reading for leaderboard
    }
    
    // Quests are readable by all authenticated users, writable by admins only
    match /quests/{questId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.isAdmin == true;
    }
    
    // Badges are readable by all authenticated users, writable by admins only
    match /badges/{badgeId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.isAdmin == true;
    }
    
    // Submissions are readable/writable by the user who created them, and readable by admins
    match /submissions/{submissionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.isAdmin == true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Firebase Storage Rules

Add these rules to your Firebase Storage:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow users to upload submissions to their own folder
    match /submissions/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      // Allow admins to read all submissions
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/(default)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
        get(/databases/(default)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.isAdmin == true;
    }
  }
}
```
